    <div class = "chapter">
        <p>Throughout the semester, I have learned new things from each of my various classes. </p>
        <p>In English, I learned tools to improve my writing. This was one of the most helpful classes because I will take this information with me for the rest of my life and use it in many facets of my life. </p>
        <p>In calculus, I got a refresher on lessons I had previously learned, which will benefit me next semester when I take calculus two. </p>
        <p>A class I learned the most new information was intro to microeconomics. This kind of study differed from most things I learned in high school; however, I found it very interesting to see how economics and business correspond. I learned about different markets like monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic, and perfect competition. They all had differences that made them better in some aspects and atrocious in others. </p>
        <p>The intro to computer programming was another brand new class. In high school, I took java and html classes, but I had never seen python before. The class was not only beneficial in teaching me python, but it also taught me some other basic programming lessons that I will take with me. </p>
        <p>My last class, Science Gateway Seminar, taught me a wide variety of topics, including AI, autonomous cars, and facial recognition. My knowledge was limited in these topics, and it helped open my eyes to the larger world of technology. </p>
